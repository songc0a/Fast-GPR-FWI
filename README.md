# Fast-GPR-FWI
This repository gives the codes for "Fast ground penetrating radar dual parameters full waveform inversion method accelerated by hybrid compilation of CUDA kernel function and PyTorch". This work has been submitted to Computers and Geosciences.

# Overview
This study proposes a high-performance dual-parameter full waveform inversion framework (FWI) for ground-penetrating radar (GPR), accelerated through the hybrid compilation of CUDA kernel functions and PyTorch. The method leverages the computational efficiency of GPU programming while preserving the flexibility and usability of Python-based deep learning frameworks. By integrating customized CUDA kernels into PyTorchâ€™s automatic differentiation mechanism.
